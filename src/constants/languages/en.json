When we pray the rosary, we do nothing but ask the Virgin Mary for her help to remain in spiritual union with Jesus, to reach him.\n\nThe rosary is a Christian prayer that serves to commemorate the 20 mysteries of the life and work of Jesus Christ and the Virgin Mary. They are recited after announcing each of the mysteries with an Our Father, ten Hail Marys and a glory to the Father. "
